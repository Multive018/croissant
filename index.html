        The Croissant

    <p>
      A <strong>croissant</strong> (French pronunciation: [k Åwas…ëÃÉ]) is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.
      Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. 
      The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.

      <h3>Types of Croissants</h3>
      <ul>
        <li class="croissant-name">
          Croissant Au Beurre
        </li>
        <p class="croissant-type">
          This variant of the flaky pastry is delicious, as it is made with lots of butter. With every bite, your taste buds are treated to the salty, flavoursome taste of butter. Theobroma‚Äôs butter croissant is crescent shaped and made up of over 70 layers of flaky pastry. 
          It pairs well with tea and coffee so add this to your breakfast menu or enjoy it as a teatime snack.
        </p>
        <li class="croissant-name">
          Pain Au Chocolat
        </li>
        <p class="croissant-type">
          This type of croissant has the goodness of two tasty ingredients - butter and chocolate. The croissant is made by folding bars of chocolate into the buttery dough and then baking it. 
          Theobroma‚Äôs pain au chocolat is made by folding pure couverture chocolate between Danish pastry dough.
        </p>
        <li class="croissant-name">Croissant Aux Amandes
        </li>
        <p class="croissant-type">
          Also known as almond croissants, they are made with a filling of almond cream and garnished with sliced almonds. The croissants are then re-baked till they attain a crispy texture.
        </p>
        <li class="croissant-name">Pain Aux Raisins
        </li>
        <p class="croissant-type">
        This type of croissant comes with raisins or a filling of custard or almond cream. It is a sweet, flaky pastry that can be enjoyed as is, or with a warm beverage like tea or coffee. 
          Because of the various fillings, it makes for a satisfying snack.
        </p>
        <li class="croissant-name">Croissant Ordinaries
        </li>
        <p class="croissant-type">
          This is an ordinary croissant and can be made with margarine instead of butter. It is usually crescent-shaped, but lacks the buttery flavour of a croissant au beurre. 
          This type of croissant can be enjoyed for breakfast and can even be made into a sandwich by slicing it in half and adding your favourite sandwich fillings.
